#JavaScript Review

This project uses Jasmine-based tests to help review core JavaScript concepts.

##Running the tests

Of course, the included Jasmine specs can be run in many ways.  Since I'm currently
experimenting with Python/Django environments, I used the instructions found here
to help with abstraction of the Jasmine implementation:

##Installation Notes
1 - On Ubuntu, run this command to install the `python-dev` dependency
		
		sudo apt-get install python-dev
